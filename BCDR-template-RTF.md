## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the disaster recovery (DR) and business continuity (BC) plan for the Azure RTF AKS infrastructure, ensuring minimal downtime and data loss in the event of a disaster.

### 1.2 Scope
This plan covers the AKS environment, including applications and data hosted on the AKS clusters.

## 2. Risk Assessment

Identify potential risks and their impact on the AKS environment, including but not limited to:

- Natural disasters
- Infrastructure failures
- Data breaches
- Service outages

## 3. Backup and Restore Strategy

### 3.1 Azure AKS Snapshots
Implement regular snapshots of AKS clusters using Azure Backup. Define backup frequency and retention policies based on application criticality.

### 3.2 Application Data
Ensure application data is backed up using Azure Storage, Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL, or other suitable Azure services. Define backup and restore procedures for application-specific data.

## 4. High Availability

### 4.1 AKS Multi-Zone Deployment
Deploy AKS across multiple availability zones to ensure high availability. Configure the AKS cluster for automatic failover.

### 4.2 Application Redundancy
Design applications to be resilient to failures by deploying multiple instances across AKS nodes and zones.

## 5. Monitoring and Alerting

Implement monitoring solutions for AKS clusters using Azure Monitor. Set up alerts for key metrics related to resource usage, performance, and availability.

## 6. Incident Response

Define incident response procedures for different types of disasters. Include steps for identifying, escalating, and resolving incidents.

## 7. Communication Plan

Establish a communication plan for notifying stakeholders in the event of a disaster. Include contact information for key personnel and communication channels.

## 8. Testing

Regularly test the DR plan to ensure its effectiveness. Conduct simulated disaster scenarios and evaluate the response and recovery procedures.

## 9. Documentation

Maintain up-to-date documentation for the DR and BC plan, including configurations, procedures, and contact information.

## 10. Review and Update

Regularly review and update the DR and BC plan to accommodate changes in the AKS environment, applications, and business requirements.
